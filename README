 ) -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  )


 )
(   Features
 )

-- Easy userspace threads
-- Thread preemption after 10ms time slice
-- Mutexes


 )
(   Usage
 )

-- Look at thread_test.c to see basic thread usage,
   and mutex_test.c for mutex usage.

-- But basically:
    
    twine_init();           // start the library
    twine_create(foo, x);   // create a thread
    twine_yield();          // yield control to another thread


(
 )  Notes
( 

-- Only compiles on Linux (or anything with the makecontext, 
   setcontext, etc. functions, which for some reason are
   missing on OSX).


( 
 )  Improvements
(

-- Currently the twine_create function only accepts functions that
   return void and have one argument.  I know of no way of getting
   around the void return, but you can allow more arguments by
   changing our call to makecontext in thread.c.  See
   /usr/includes/ucontext.h for details.

-- Figuring out a better slice time (10ms was pretty much picked
   at random), or letting the user set it when he calls twine_init.
