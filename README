(   Features
 )

-- Easy userspace threads
-- Thread preemption after 10ms time slice
-- Mutexes


 )
(   Usage
 )

-- Look at simplethreads.c to see basic thread usage,
   and simplemutex.c for mutex usage.


(
 )  Notes
( 

-- Only compiles on Linux (or anything with the makecontext, 
   setcontext, etc. functions, which for some reason are
   missing on OSX).

( 
 )  Improvements
(

-- I'm probably not going to do any more work on this, but if I
   were, here are some possible improvements that could be made -
   or you could fork, implement them or others, and I'll pull it 
   back.

-- Currently the twine_create function only accepts functions that
   return void and have one argument.  I know of no way of getting
   around the void return, but you can allow more arguments by
   changing our call to makecontext in thread.c.  makecontext's 
   args are these: ucontext_t struct, function pointer, number
   of arguments to that function, and the arguments of that function
   make up the last of makecontext's arguments.

-- Figuring out a better slice time (10ms was pretty much picked
   at random), or letting the user set it when he calls twine_init.

-- Priority scheduling - I had planned on having it, but I never got
   around to it.
